      "The fields are: root restricting layer depth, precipitation, plant available water content, average annual reference evapotranspiration, land use/land cover, watersheds, subwatersheds, biophysical table, z parameter, and demand table. The first five on the list are all of the raster datasets required. They measure how much water is going into, coming out of, and being retained in the soil. The watersheds and subwatersheds are polygons that represent the exact location of where and how the water is retained and moves about in the region. The biophysical and demand tables are charts that explain the categories and attributes of the land use/land cover raster dataset. Lastly, the Z parameter measures how much water is expected to fall and be retained in the region in question and places in on a scale from 1 to 30. The Z parameter has been found in two distinct ways, the simpler is multiplying 0.2 and the number of rain events per year. and it could be an accurate depiction of the Z parameter."
